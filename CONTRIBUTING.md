# Thanks for adding your magic! âœ¨

either with big or small contributions, we are happy to have you!

This guide covers how and where to get started.

## Code of Conduct ðŸ”®

When interacting with the project, the
[Covenant Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies.

## Use of Generative AI ðŸ¤–

This project does not allow contributions generated by LLMs (Large Languages
Models) and chatbots. This ban includes tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot,
DeepSeek, Devin AI, or any other tools like that. We are taking these steps as
precaution due to the potential negative influence of AI generated content on
quality, as well as likely copyright violations.

This ban of AI generated content applies to all parts of the projects,
including, but not limited to, code, documentation, issues, and artworks. An
exception applies for purely translating texts for Issues, Discussions, and
their comments to English.

Since AI generated information is frequently misleading or false, we cannot
supply support on anything referencing AI output.
