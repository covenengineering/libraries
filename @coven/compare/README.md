ðŸªž Minimalistic deep comparison.

This library takes 2 values (a `left` and a `right`) and returns an iterator
with all the differences between said values. The differences are represented by
3 kinds:

- **Create:** Missing `left` and existing `right`.
- **Update:** Different `left` and `right` values.
- **Delete:** Existing `left` and missing `right`.

## Example

```typescript
import { compare } from "@coven/compare";

compare("Coven", "Engineering"); // Yields { kind: "UPDATE", left: "Coven", right: "Engineering" }
```
