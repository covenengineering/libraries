 *
 * @example Create character class
 * ```typescript
 * characterClass("âœ¨", "ðŸ”®", "ðŸ’€"); // [âœ¨ðŸ”®ðŸ’€]

 * @see [Character class](https://coven.to/mdn/Reference/Regular_expressions/Character_class)
 * @param tokens Tokens to put on the set.
 * @returns Character class with given `tokens` on it.
