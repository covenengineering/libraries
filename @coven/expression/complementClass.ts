/**
 * Matches any character not enclosed by this function. You can specify a range
 * of characters by using a hyphen, but if the hyphen appears as the first or
 * last character enclosed in the square brackets, it is taken as a literal
 * hyphen to be excluded in the complement class as a normal character.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * complementClass("âœ¨", "ðŸ”®", "ðŸ’€"); // [^âœ¨ðŸ”®ðŸ’€]
 * ```
 * @see [Character class](https://coven.to/mdn/Reference/Regular_expressions/Character_class)
 * @param tokens Tokens to put on the set.
 * @returns Complement class with given `tokens` on it.
