üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Magical regular expressions composer.

It is really easy to mess big regular expressions by forgetting some character.
So, instead of using plain strings, `@coven/expression` provides a set of
functions and constants strongly typed, so the type is already a hardcoded
string that reflects the regular expression being built, while giving an API
that's easier to read and maintain.

Like all [Coven Engineering](https://coven.engineering) libraries, it has 100%
test coverage and it's built in top of modern tech compatible with all
JavaScript runtimes.

## Example

```typescript
import { buildUnicode, disjunction, group } from "@coven/expression";

buildUnicode(group(disjunction("this", "that"))); // /(?:this|that)/u
```
