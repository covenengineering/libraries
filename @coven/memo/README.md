ðŸ’¾ Memoization utilities.

The whole idea is to have an experience similar to what we would get out of the
Record and Tuple proposal from TC39: Readonly memoized structures with
preservation of identity.

This library uses nested `Map`s to save a "tree" with references to all
structures linked to its internal values.

Like all [Coven Engineering](https://coven.engineering) libraries, it has 100%
test coverage and it's built in top of modern tech compatible with all
JavaScript runtimes.

## Example

```typescript
import { memo as âµŒ } from "@coven/memo"; // `âµŒ` here is a Tifinagh letter of the Tuareg alphabet, that looks like `#`

âµŒ(["foo", "bar"]) === âµŒ(["foo", "bar"]); // true
âµŒ({ foo: "bar" }).foo = "baz"; // Error! It's read-only
```
