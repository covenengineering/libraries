ðŸ’¾ Memoization utilities.

The whole idea is to have an experience similar to what we would get out of the
Record and Tuple proposal from TC39: Readonly memoized structures with
preservation of identity.

This library uses nested `Map`s to save a "tree" with references to all
structures linked to its internal values.

Like all [Coven Engineering](https://coven.engineering) libraries, it has 100%
test coverage and it's built in top of modern tech compatible with all
JavaScript runtimes.

## Example

```typescript
import { memo } from "@coven/memo";

memo(["foo", "bar"]) === memo(["foo", "bar"]); // true
```
