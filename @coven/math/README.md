ðŸ’€ Math witchcraft.

Using this library, adding `0.2` + `0.1` will result in `0.3`, and that might
look like nothing to the untrained eye, but it's not
[what JavaScript usually does](https://0.30000000000000004.com/).

The way we achieve this is by using a tuple we called `Precise` which contains a
representation of the base and exponent of a number using `bigint`. We then do
all math operations over base and exponent in those tuples and turn them back to
`number` when we are done.

As all [Coven Engineering](https://coven.engineering) libraries, it has 100%
test coverage and it's built in top of modern tech compatible with all
JavaScript runtimes.

## Example

```typescript
import { calculate } from "@coven/math";

calculate(0.1).add(0.2); // 0.3 ðŸ¤¯
```
