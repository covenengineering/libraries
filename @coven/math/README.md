ðŸ’€ Math witchcraft.

Using this library, adding `0.2` + `0.1` will result in `0.3`, and that might
look like nothing to the untrained eye, but it's not
[what JavaScript usually does](https://0.30000000000000004.com/).

## Example

```typescript
import { add } from "@coven/math";

add(0.1, 0.2); // 0.3 ðŸ¤¯
```
