üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Predicate utilities.

This library offers a collection of common predicate functions to check for
type, instances, presence of properties and more.

Like all [Coven Engineering](https://coven.engineering) libraries, it has 100%
test coverage and it's built in top of modern tech compatible with all
JavaScript runtimes.

## Example

```typescript
import { isBoolean } from "@coven/predicates";

isBoolean(true); // true
isBoolean(false); // true
isBoolean(undefined); // false
```
