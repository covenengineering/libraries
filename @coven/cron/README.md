‚è≥ A fantastic cron parser and constructor.

This library is the fastest, smallest and safest cron expression parser out
there. This is because it uses a regular expression (built with
[`@coven/expression`](https://jsr.io/@coven/expression)) to parse strings into a
consumable object, and the parse back is done by really quick curried functions
and generators.

It also includes a `nextDate` util that given a `Date` and a valid cron
expression, will return the next matching date. It does validations beforehand
so no "Invalid Date" errors are returned.

As all [Coven Engineering](https://coven.engineering) libraries, it has 100%
test coverage and it's built in top of modern tech compatible with all
JavaScript runtimes.

Only known limitation is it only accepts valid standard unix cron expressions,
so cron quartz is not supported.

## Example

```typescript
import { parse, stringify } from "@coven/cron";

const cron = parse("1-2,3,4 * 2 8,9 1");
/*
	{
		minutes: [{ from: 1, to: 2 }, 3, 4],
		hours: "*",
		dayOfMonth: 2,
		month: [8, 9],
		dayOfWeek: 1
	}
*/

stringify(cron); // "1-2,3,4 * 2 8,9 1"

// Also works with partials:
stringify({ hours: 13 }); // "* 13 * * *"

// Only parses with valid dates:
parse("* * 31 2 *"); // undefined because 31 of February is invalid
```
